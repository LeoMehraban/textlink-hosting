It's all just text and links

Download TextLink at http://github.com/LeoMehraban/TextLink. This is not a TextLink link becuse TextLink can't show html pages, but go check it out
Run textlink from your terminal.
In the TextLink folder, run "node index.js"
Make sure you have Node.JS installed before running this command.
Install nodeJS here: https://nodejs.org/en/. (Not a TextLink link)
TextLink is over a year old, and I'm still the only person who knows how to use it, so that's sad

Goodbye.
